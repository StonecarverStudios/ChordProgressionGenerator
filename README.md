# 🎶Chord Progression Generator🎶
## Description 🎵
  This is a project made primarily with python. Utilizing the library musicpy. This app generates chord progresstions that you can use as inspiration for your composition/songwriting journey!
## Feature Ideas 📋 🗃️
- Button to generate random chord progressions
  - Default 5 chords, but user can change range of possible number of chords  
- You can see the chords in the roman numeral format  
  - And choose a key to see what exactly those chords would be  
- An ability to playback chord progesstions and user input to customize duration, tempo, etc
  - User can also customize which instrument plays the progression
- User can write in their own pre-made chord progressions to demo their own ideas
- User can save favorite chord progessions and save ones they pre-made
  - Notes app like function to notate and markup ideas for uses with a specific chord progression
- User can 'analyze progression' and see what the chords look like on a virtual piano, and see chords in standard music note notation
- Slider to get progressions on a scale from conventonal to jazzy/experimental
## Problems we need to solve❗🔊 
### How will the code "know" what chords to use?
  - Maybe favor certain "basic" chords? (I V more common than other chords?)
  - Setting rules, like where it has to 'resolve' to the I (More likley to end on a V or V7)
### Converting chords from a specific key to a Roman numeral and vise versa
### Will This be a web application with HTML, CSS, And Javascript? Or Just a stand alone application?
