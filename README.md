# 🎶Chord Progression Generator🎶
## Description 🎵

A full‑stack music tool built with a **React + Vite** frontend and a **Flask** backend.  
This app helps musicians and composers spark ideas by generating randomized chord progressions based on key, mode, chord count, and optional “spiciness.”

Powered by **MusicPy** for harmonic logic and **SoundFont synthesis** for real‑time audio playback, it provides instant musical inspiration for songwriting and composition. Enjoy! 🙂
