//////////NOTES//////////////
How will the code "know" what chords to use?
Maybe favor certain "basic" chords? (I V more common than other chords?)
Setting rules, like where it has to 'resolve' to the I (More likley to end on a V or V7)

 .pick_chord_by_degree
   - Selects chords based on scale degrees (like I, ii, iii, etc.).
   - Degree is relative to the tonic of the scale.
   - Follows musical harmony logic â€” stacking notes by thirds (or other intervals).
   - Useful for building diatonic chords (chords that naturally occur in the scale).
   -S('C major').pick_chord_by_degree(4) //Returns the 5th chord of C major: G major (G, B, D)

.pick_chord_by_index
   - Selects notes by absolute index positions in the scale.
   - You provide a list of indices (0-based) to pick specific notes.
   - More manual and flexible, not bound to harmonic rules 
   -S('C major').pick_chord_by_index([0, 2, 4]) //creates C major chord

.pattern
   -you can extract the chord progression of a mode by entering a string or integer representing the chord scale
   -S('C major').pattern(6451) ///
Key: common notes
